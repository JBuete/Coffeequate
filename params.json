{"name":"Coffeequate","tagline":"A computer algebra system for JavaScript.","body":"# Algebra in the browser.\r\nNo matter how hard you try, `-webkit-calc()` is not going to be able to solve an equation. Neither is JavaScript.\r\n\r\nThat's where Coffeequate comes in.\r\n\r\nCoffeequate is a computer algebra system (CAS) for JavaScript. It can manipulate algebraic expressions, and solve and simplify equations.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n* Solve quadratic and linear equations.\r\n* Simplify algebraic expressions.\r\n* Propagate uncertainties in an expression.\r\n* Substitute numbers and other expressions into existing expressions.\r\n* Handle variables, constants, and symbolic constants (like Ï€ or G).\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\nLoading Coffeequate into your webpage is as simple as including it in a script tag:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"coffeequate.min.js\"></script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can also load it with an AMD loader like [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/):\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\ndefine([\"lib/coffeequate.min\"], function (coffeequate) {\r\n    // Use Coffeequate here!\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Examples\r\n#### Solving an equation\r\n```javascript\r\n// If E = mc**2, then what does m equal?\r\nE = new coffeequate.Equation(\"E = m * c ** 2\");\r\nconsole.log(E.solve(\"m\").toString()); // m = E/(c**2)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Upcoming Features\r\n\r\n## Frequently Asked Questions","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
